# Headline Traits Behind Top Serving Native Ads

Native ads, AKA the degenerate affiliate's playground, promises massive scale for the right advert.

For the right broad appeal product, we're talking about $40k in spend a day until other affiliates swipe your content and drag down efficiency.

But what does it take to succeed selling a product in this environment? Sure, ad arbitrage can work (albeit with razor thing margins for all but few). But getting users to part with their hard earned money is a different ball game.

**Let's take a look at the top 100 performing native ad headlines and see what they have in common**

According to Anstrex, the ads with the highest "Ad-Gravity" are the following. These advertisers are performing incredibly well in terms of their ad rank and frequency they show up.

And what we see is....

✅ Half naked women

✅ Old happy people

✅ Cute puppies

Sounds about right.

Let's dig in!

The most common theme of [the top 170 headlines running today](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cIySiyl24yGDr7Yiccy2Fp0dsjirWwR7fkiG8JbJ9zs/edit?usp=sharing) are:

**An offer** that explicity states the ad wants to give the user something. Like "Get Dog Food Designed for Your Dog's Health & Happiness"

**A surprising fact** that teases some content like "The Science Behind Love Is Actually More Complex Than We Think"

**Sensational / visual appeal** headlines that tease something like "Sarah Huckabee's Transformation Is A Staggering Sight To See"

**Newsworthy content** (again clickbait) like "The Truth About Donald Trump's Son Is Out Now & We're Surprised"

**A question** that opens up a dialog about the product like "Should You Buy an Electric Car?"

## Winning elements of top headlines that target commercial intent

There's _lots_ of smut and ad fraud being pushed on native.

The most interesting (to me) style of ads are the ones that are able to sell a product.

**Here are a few great examples of brands crushing on native:**

### Purple Mattress

<a target={"_blank"} href={"https://purple.com/blog/too-stressed-to-sleep"}>Landing Page</a>


<img src={"/purple-mattress-native.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

**Why This Works:**

The promise of the content is to explain how stress and sleep are correlated. This is:
1. A massively broad offer. Nearly everyone has dealt with this issue before
2. Promises to be science based and useful. If one can understand this relationship, the implication is that sleep can be better
3. The image captures the feeling. A bored/upset looking woman staring directly into the screen. Eye contact tends to perform best and she captures the problem well.

### Ring Camera

<a target={"_blank"} href={"https://blog.ring.com/products-innovation/ring-devices-help-make-peace-of-mind-more-accessible-to-all/"}>Landing Page</a>

<img src={"/ring-native.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

**Why This Works:**

I'll admit this is an odd one. But this piece is more newsworthy and entertainment driven than it may first seem.

The story behind the picture is the woman has Down Syndrome, and Ring enables her family to watch her while she's out front.

The advertorial then goes into more stories of how Ring is used.

"Use" stories help potential customers imagine the benefits of the product.

And while this advert might not be totally direct response, it's likely a useful touch point.


### Spy.com (apparel affiliate)

<a target={"_blank"} href={"https://spy.com/articles/gear/style/best-places-to-buy-college-apparel-1202788151/"}>Landing page</a>

<img src={"/spy-affiliate.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

**Why This Works:**

Pay attention to the date. College is starting back up and that's prime time for parents to buy clothes showing school pride.

The headline combines an offer of "we'll sell you college branded clothes" with a promise of ease:

**The Best Places** to Buy College Apparel **Make Showing College Pride Too Easy**

They sell the product _and_ the click in one headline.


### Disruptive store about TV product

<a target={"_blank"} href={"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KvI9hfK__jv19AktBNzuUJIHMMp3muXz/view?usp=drive_link"}>Preview Page Here</a>

<a href={"https://hyperxgadgets.com/intl?prod=tvsharemax&variation=tvsuperboost&net=1673"} target={"_blank"}>Offer Page</a>

<img src={"/tv-native-product.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

**Why This Works:**

This headline/image combo is a masterclass in how to write offer ads.

Paying $49/mo for all channels is pretty much unheard of.

The question of "Only $49 to get all the TV channels?" opens up a loop of curiosity. Then the ad promises "newsworthy" content of how it's now possible.

### Conclusion

That's all for today! Keep an eye out for more analysis of native ads.
