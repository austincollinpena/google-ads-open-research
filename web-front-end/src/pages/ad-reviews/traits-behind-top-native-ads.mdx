# Headline Traits Behind Top Serving Native Ads

Native ads, AKA the degenerate affiliate's playground, promises massive scale for the right advert.

For the right broad appeal product, we're talking about $40k in spend a day until other affiliates swipe your content and drag down efficiency.

But what does it take to succeed selling a product in this environment? Sure, ad arbitrage can work (albeit with razor thing margins for all but few). But getting users to part with their hard earned money is a different ball game.

**Let's take a look at the top 100 performing native ad headlines and see what they have in common**

According to Anstrex, the ads with the highest "Ad-Gravity" are the following. These advertisers are performing incredibly well in terms of their ad rank and frequency they show up.

And what we see is....

✅ Half naked women

✅ Old happy people

✅ Cute puppies

Sounds about right.

Let's dig in!

The most common theme of [the top 170 headlines running today](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cIySiyl24yGDr7Yiccy2Fp0dsjirWwR7fkiG8JbJ9zs/edit?usp=sharing) are:

**An offer** that explicity states the ad wants to give the user something. Like "Get Dog Food Designed for Your Dog's Health & Happiness"

**A surprising fact** that teases some content like "The Science Behind Love Is Actually More Complex Than We Think"

**Sensational / visual appeal** headlines that tease something like "Sarah Huckabee's Transformation Is A Staggering Sight To See"

**Newsworthy content** (again clickbait) like "The Truth About Donald Trump's Son Is Out Now & We're Surprised"

**A question** that opens up a dialog about the product like "Should You Buy an Electric Car?"

## Winning elements of top headlines that target commercial intent

There's _lots_ of smut and ad fraud being pushed on native.

The most interesting (to me) style of ads are the ones that are able to sell a product.

**Here are a few great examples of brands crushing on native:**
