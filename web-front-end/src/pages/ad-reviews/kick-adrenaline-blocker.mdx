# How a Single Angle Drives a Successful Brand

Showing **before and after** state is one of the easiest ways to reach **problem aware** prospects.

In today's quick ad review, we're going to luck at this successful funnel from gokick.com and how they're leveraging a single, powerful angle to drive sales.

## The Assets

<img src={"/kick-meta-ad.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>
<img src={"/kick-landing-page-above-the-fold.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

Let's take what we have here one by one and to illustrate why these ads have been able to run for months. (And how you can take what Kick is doing and test it yourself).


## Ad headline breakdown

<img src={"/kick-headline-breakdown.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

No word in this headline is wasted.

<span
    class={"!text-[#E37272] font-bold"}>Nervous introvert presenters</span> cleanly calls out the reader while opening up a problem. In so many cases advertisers use

> Attention [insert group here], Are you facing [insert problem here]?

Kick masterfully provides this in a single phrase, making the ad read quickly and naturally.

<span className={"font-bold"}>...are using our <span
    class={"text-[#3EAB49]"}>"adrenaline blockers"</span></span> introduces the unique mechanism. Why could this work? There's a new way that this can be treated.

The mechanism, wrapped in quotes, serves to provide proof for this audience as well as inspire curiosity as to what "adrenaline blockers" are.

<span className={"font-bold"}>to go from <span className={"text-[#403EAB]"}>"shaky and sweaty"</span> to <span
    className={"text-[#A93EAB]"}>"confidently cool"</span></span> cleanly illustrates the before and after state of the prospect.

*The value of this ad is simple and can't be restated in a shorter manner*

The copy:
1. Targets the user
2. Provides a unique mechanism
3. Shows a before an after state

All within 17 words.

*Curious to see the rest of the copy? I'll paste it below*

## The landing page

The landing page is another masterclass of simplicity and effectiveness.

I'll go by, section after section, and explain why this page works so well including:

1. A simple hero that builds on the promise of the ad
2. A two-part testimonial section that provides FOMO and major trust signals
3. An intermediate CTA to sell after the testimonials
4. A killer guarantee to remove the risk of taking the action on the page
5. A triplet of comparisons to other solutions the reader may have tried to smash any remaining objections

[Here's a working backup of the page in case they change things.](https://swipe-file.pages.dev/Kick%20_%20Adrenaline%20Blockers%20For%20Presentation%20Anxiety%20(5_10_2023%2010_43_43%20AM))

### A simple hero that builds on the promise of the ad

This is *exactly* what a user would expect after clicking on the before ad.

<img src={"/kick-lander-highlighted.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

<span class={"!text-[#980089] font-bold"}>Block Public Speaking Nerves</span>

The main headline of the page restates the promise from the ad.

<span class={"!text-[#984900] font-bold"}>From "Shaky & Sweaty" To "Confidently Cool"
Trusted by top execs, salespeople, students... and surgeons</span>

The subhead (wisely) restates the ad, and ads more identification about who uses it.

The primary audience for this offer is nervous speakers, **not** top execs or surgeons. But by adding these in, the reader can rationalize "If it works for them, it must work for me."

<span class={"!text-[#009821] font-bold"}>Adrenaline blockers stop racing heart, shaky voice, and sweaty palms for your best presentation ever</span>

This builds on the unique mechanism. The "what" or "adrenaline blockers" are connected to the outcome of better presentations and no more symptoms.

<span class={"!text-[#989200] font-bold"}>Get Prescription-Strength Confidence</span>

This CTA continues to build on the exact same promise. The benefit to clicking the button is clear.

<span class={"!text-[#006A98] font-bold"}>No insurance, appointment, or video call needed</span>

The subhead under the button handles objections around how much time this could take, increasing the likelihood the user continues.

The **most likely action** of any user is **inaction**. By removing friction to taking an action, this page combats inaction.

### A two-part testimonial section that provides FOMO and major trust signals

This killer two-part testimonial section starts with trustpilot reviews, and ends with 2 TikTok embeds.

<img src={"/kick-testimonial-1.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

**Wow** what a testimonial from STAT Medical News.

<span
    class={"!text-[#980089] font-bold"}>A 'magic pill' jump-starts a career</span>. Everyone wants a magic pill. A legit-sounding publication to reinforce the effort to impact ratio of using Kick is proof to the reader that Kick works.

<p></p>
<span
    class={"!text-[#002B98] font-bold"}>16 hours ago</span>. Kick is showing their reviews through a third party, **while also** showing that reviews have come in within the last 16 hours. Not only is Kick trusted, but they're being used by real people **today**.

To continue the testimonial section, Kick adds a TikTok embed of two women reviewing th product.

As of September 2023, a product on TikTok = a product that's trendy.

The TikTok embeds are a great way to both show how real users like the product and its popularity.

<img src={"/kick-testimonial-2.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

### An intermediate CTA to sell after the testimonials

After testimonials, users are primed to buy. Kick adds a new CTA that summarizes all the key points from above to give the user another chance to click through and buy.

<img src={"/kick-intermediate-cta.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

### A killer guarantee to remove the risk of taking the action on the page

A great guarantee understands the risk that a user is taking and seeks to remove it.

In this case, Kick guarantees two things:

1. You will only be charged if the doctor prescribes you the medication
2. (Put more subtly) The worst case scenario is you lose 10 minutes of your life

<img src={"/kick-guarantee.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

Additionally, they put the exact pricing on the page. While it should be tested, this ensures that only high quality clicks continue through the funnel.

### A triplet of comparisons to other solutions the reader may have tried to smash any remaining objections

This next section, for users who are hardest to convince, follows this format:

- Call out about Kick
- Comparison with other solution
- Show why Kick is better
- Image

<img src={"/kick-feature-1.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

<span class={"!text-[#980089] font-bold"}>"Kick" Racing Heartbeat, Shaky Voice & Sweaty Palms</span>

Reinforce the core brand promise.

<span class={"!text-[#984900] font-bold"}>Other solutions don’t address what's behind your public speaking fears - An overactive nervous system.</span>

Illustrate the reason the other solutions don't work.

<span class={"!text-[#009821] font-bold"}>Kick blocks adrenaline and the stress hormones that distract you from delivering a confidently cool presentation.</span>

Make it clear that Kick resolves the "hidden" problem that other solutions don't.

<img src={"/kick-feature-2.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

<span class={"!text-[#980089] font-bold"}>Control Nerves Without Brain Fog</span>

Users that have tried other solutions may have an objection about "brain fog," or at least hear that it could be an issue.

Kick is able to give you the solution, without a common drawback.

<span class={"!text-[#984900] font-bold"}>Xanax or alcohol can make you feel foggy and out of focus. They may also be addictive.</span>

Other solutions users may have tried are stated with the negative side effects.

<span class={"!text-[#009821] font-bold"}>Beta-blockers, however, are non habit-forming and keep you calm, confident & alert during the most important presentations.</span>

Kick's medication category is stated to have none of the negative side effects, while retaining the positive ones.

<img src={"/kick-feature-2.png"} loading={"lazy"}/>

<span class={"!text-[#980089] font-bold"}>Online Performance Medicine</span>

Not everyone has gotten a prescription online. This section introduces how convenient Kick is.

<span class={"!text-[#984900] font-bold"}>Seeing a doctor in person requires an inconvenient appointment and insurance.</span>

Again, Kick contrasts their process with a traditional solution.

<span class={"!text-[#009821] font-bold"}>Kick's doctors complete your visit within 12-24 hours and are experts in treating presentation anxiety.</span>

Kick's doctors are fast and specialized.

## Why Kick's funnel works

There's a major difference between what **earns the ad click** and what **earns the sale**.

In Kick's case, they found an angle that can do both.

Here's what they do right:

1. The ad calls out an audience that suffers from a problem in a way that intrigues them
2. The landing page is a perfect continuation of the ad
3. Landing page elements like testimonials, guarantees, and comparisons overcome lingering objections and make the sale

#### Kick's long form ad copy:

Nervous introvert presenters are using our “adrenaline blockers” to go from “shaky and sweaty” to “confidently cool.”

After witnessing thousands of celebrities, performers, and executives overcome “stage anxiety,” I’ve realized the real problem.

It’s NOT that they’re introverts or shy…

… They simply have an overactive nervous system.

Which makes it almost biologically impossible to be calm on stage.

The solution isn’t years of ‘Toastmasters’ training.

All they need is the “insider’s edge” to instantly block adrenaline….

See, I talk to people every day who avoid important presentations at all costs.

Because of a racing heartbeat.. sweaty palms… shaky voice… dry mouth… tunnel vision.

They’ve failed classes, bombed job interviews, or missed out on promotions.

They’ve been “left out” in a society that prizes confidence.

They turn down and avoid great opportunities because they fear they will only embarrass themselves.

It was the same for me.

Anytime I had to perform under pressure, I had a debilitating knot in my stomach…

🥵 Flushing and sweating
😐 Mind went blank
🤢 Uncontrollable shaky legs

But the worst part was always wondering how different my life could be if I had risen to the occasion.

Instead of falling on my face.

Then one day, I was catching up with a psychologist friend…

And he casually mentioned some studies on an "insider's edge" that people used to release and overcome extreme fears.

I had never heard of anything like it. I dove headfirst into the research.

It turns out that the majority of professional musicians have used this edge.

And they’re not the only ones.

This “insider’s edge” is used by salespeople, marketing execs, grad students, pop stars, lawyers, stand-up comedians, Broadway stars, and even surgeons.

The Kardashians recently mentioned it on their own TV show.

So the next time I had to present, I tried this “edge”...

And I confidently nailed my talk.

For the first time in my entire life, I CONFIDENTLY “felt like myself” during my pitch.

I was fully present. The nerves were gone. I showed up and gave my best presentation ever.

I started wondering why no one else had heard about this.

And here’s what I discovered:

The racing heartbeat and sweaty, shaky palms come from a surge of adrenaline in your body.

That’s the classic “fight or flight” hormone response to danger.

It’s great when we’re being chased by a lion.

Not great if we’re afraid of a stage...

When our body OVERproduces adrenaline, we get performance anxiety.

But the “insider’s edge” BLOCKS high levels of adrenaline…

…and restores it to optimal levels - which keeps us confidently cool.

This “edge” has been common knowledge in medical circles for 50 years.

It’s a simple, cheap, and safe treatment known as a “beta-blocker”...

To be taken ONLY AS NEEDED an hour before any nerve-wracking event.

And even naturally nervous introverts EXUDE “prescription-strength” confidence.

However, beta-blockers for blocking adrenaline have been hard to get in the past.

I had to see an expensive psychiatrist to get my prescription.

Ouch.

Everyone should have easy access to performance medicine at an affordable price. So I teamed up with a Stanford-trained psychiatrist to start Kick Health.

Kick is the first online performance medicine clinic devoted to helping you overcome those ‘shakes and sweats’ to stay confidently cool during big moments.

And we’ve worked to make this system as simple as possible.

Just fill out a simple intake in less than 10 minutes on our website instead of scheduling an inconvenient in-person doctor’s appointment.

And a board-certified doctor will issue a prescription (if appropriate).

All for only $49. 👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️

https://www.gokick.com/r/fb-imgtb-confidently-cool

We also partner with a mail-order pharmacy to deliver the medication directly to your door for only $20 more. 💊

✔️ No insurance necessary.
✔️ No monthly fees.
✔️ No appointment, video, or phone call needed.

We even offer a "Doctor's Guarantee," so you don't get charged until a doctor determines the prescription is suitable for you.

If you’re ready to finally block that "adrenaline overdrive" and present "confidently cool"...
