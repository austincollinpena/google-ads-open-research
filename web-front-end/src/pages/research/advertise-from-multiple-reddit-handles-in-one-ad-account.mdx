**Before**: Each Reddit ad account was tied to a single profile. /u/austin could only advertise in one ad account.

**Now**: You can advertise from multiple handles within one ad account. /u/austin can be in one ad, and /u/justin can be in another.

    ## Step 1: Create a second business manager for your _new_ profile

    You need **two** business managers. Yes, this is annoying. No, you can't get around this.

    [Follow the instructions here to create a business manager](https://business.reddithelp.com/s/article/Create-and-manage-your-Reddit-Ads-account.)

    Every profile you want to advertise from needs its OWN business manager.

    ### Let's name the business managers for sake of clarity

    The one you want to run ads from? We'll call it the **primary** business manager.

    The one with the alternate profile? We'll call it the **alternate profile** business manager.

    ## Step 2: Share the profile

    Log in to the **primary** business manager. Find your Business ID.

    <Image
        alt="find the business ID"
        src="/advertise-from-multiple-reddit-handles/business-id.png"
        AspectRatio=""
    />

    Now go to your **alternate profile** business manager. Add the **primary** business manager ID as a new partner.

    <Image
        alt="find the business ID"
        src="/advertise-from-multiple-reddit-handles/add-partner.png"
        AspectRatio=""
    />

    Your business manager will look like this:

    <Image
        alt="find the business ID"
        src="/advertise-from-multiple-reddit-handles/primary-will-be-here.png"
        AspectRatio=""
    />

    <em>Put another way: your alternate profile business manager SHARES the profile to the primary business manager.</em>

    ## Step 3: Accept Invite

    In your **primary** business manager, go to partners/invitations.

    Click accept.

    <Image
        alt="find the business ID"
        src="/advertise-from-multiple-reddit-handles/alt-profile-will-be-here.png"
        AspectRatio=""
    />

    ## Step 4: Share the ad account

    In your **primary** business manager, click to the "Profiles" on the side bar.

    Click "Assign Ad Accounts" under the newly shared profile.

    <Image
        alt="find the business ID"
        src="/advertise-from-multiple-reddit-handles/assign-ad-accounts.png"
        AspectRatio=""
    />

    ## Step 5: Make your ad

    Go to any one of your ads.

    You should now be able to choose different handles for your ads.
