# Find which of your Google Ads Competitors Are Influencing Your CTR and CPA

As far as I am aware, there has never been a commercially available solution to generate a report of this kind. The reason is, Google doesn’t allow you to access auction insights data via the API.

I’ve spoken to at least one data scientist at a big Google Ads agency that has run a report like this. So while this may be the first time an article has been published, I certainly was not the first to generate such insights.

**Here’s the summary:**

Through exporting Google Ads auction insight data day-by-day, you can monitor the changing overlap rate of competitors compared to your CTR and CPA.

It makes sense, right? If someone writes a better ad than you, and they show up more frequently, they are going to be more likely to win the click.

Or at least, if the user clicks on both of you, the better experience/offer will win the sale.

Is it very scientific? No. Is it the best you’ll get. Yes.

In this article I will talk briefly about why you would want this, and exactly how to do it.

### Why do this?

If you are testing your Google Ads (which you should be), it would be helpful to know what you’re testing against. You are competing with other advertisers. Understanding which of them are most effective will influence your testing.

You may also find instances where you are advertising for “wrong fit” keywords. For example, this report may show you competing against Amazon when you are doing lead generation.

There may be a new “upstart” competitor that is the cause of decreased performance, rather than “market conditions.”

Or you might find nothing (I doubt it though)
