**Summary**

1. Analyze your search term performance and find what should scale and what you should cut
2. Add a CPA/ROAS target to clearly see what grams are over or under your goals
3. Access and reuse the code anyway you like. [View the source code here.](https://github.com/austincollinpena/google-ads-open-research/blob/main/python_code/n_gram/vector_n_gram_for_cloud_functions.py)

_Big thank you to [Dan Willoughby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-willoughby-092539196/) and the team at [Adevolver](https://adevolver.com/) for the help with this._
